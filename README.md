#### <a name="style"> HTML CSS BootStrap</a>

Upon loading our site, the user will see several items displayed on the screen. 

<img src="">

1) A background video of waves coming ashore.
2) A gray navigation bar at the top of the webpage displaying Inspector Otter's Logo to the left and a word search bar to the right with a yellow submit button. 
3) A search area to the left where users can input their location and find cafes near the location that was input (as people who search word definitions may be new to the area). 
4) An area where previously search words are displayed for the user to see. 
5) A dark-blue colored footer with a white <img src ="assets/images/about.png" height= "25px"> button. 

Upon clicking the <img src ="assets/images/search.png" height= "25px"> button for a search word within the navigation bar, the user will be shown the **Merriam-Webster** definition of the word and Gifs, along with several **new** buttons. The four new buttons that appear when a user searches a word are <img src ="assets/images/foreignbuttons.png" height= "25px"> and <img src ="assets/images/unofficialbutton.png" height= "25px">. When any one of the Spanish, Chinese, or Russian buttons are clicked, the searched word's **translation** will be displayed. See demo below when a user inputs a word into the search bar, submits the word and then clicks on the Spanish, Chinese and Russian translation buttons.

When the unofficial definition button is clicked, the **Urban Dictionary** definition of the word searched is displayed. See demo below when a user clicks on the Unofficial Definition buttons.

When a user inputs a location into the search bar of the cafe search function, images and other information regarding local cafes will be  displayed for user convenience. See demo below when a user submits a location into the location search bar.

In terms of styling the webpage, we used <a name="bootstrap">BootStrap</a> to display the Navigation Bar, Footer, Buttons, a pop-up about page, and to make our website responsive. We also used our own CSS style sheet to change colors, fonts, positioning. Additionally we used the Inconsolata font from <a name="google"> Google Fonts</a> to display our text.

#### <a name="jumble">Jumble</a>

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ieebglCGDJJa6Q06tY/giphy.gif">

Jumble is a jQuery plugin that jumbles up the colors of your text headers, and can also be animated. We used this plugin to bring more color to our webpage. You can see the Jumble effect being used on the names of the authors in the About section of the website.
